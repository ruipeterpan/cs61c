1. How do you pass command line arguments to a program when using gdb?
run + arguments (https://github.com/db0company/UCBerkeley-cs61c/blob/master/Labs/lab02/gdb.txt)

2. How do you set a breakpoint which only occurs when a set of conditions is true (e.g. when certain variables are a certain value)?
break ... if expression

3. How do you execute the next line of C code in the program after stopping at a breakpoint?
n

4. If the next line of code is a function call, youâ€™ll execute the whole function call at once if you use your answer to #3. (If not, consider a different command for #3!) How do you tell GDB that you want to debug the code inside the function instead? (If you changed your answer to #3, then that answer is most likely now applicable here.)
s

5. How do you resume the program after stopping at a breakpoint?
continue

6. How can you see the value of a variable (or even an expression like 1+2) in gdb?
p expression

7. How do you configure gdb so it prints the value of a variable after every step?
display/format <what> (https://darkdust.net/files/GDB%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf)

8. How do you print a list of all variables and their values in the current function?
info variables

9. How do you exit out of gdb?
quit
