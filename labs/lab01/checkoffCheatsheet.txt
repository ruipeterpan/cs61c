Valgrind output suggests that the sum of array is -681778094 while it should be 15.

I'm guessing the problem is with the variable "total". I'm not sure if its type (unsigned) has something to do with this.

The use of sizeof() here is definitely problematic too. It might be the reason why this program produces inconsistent outputs.
